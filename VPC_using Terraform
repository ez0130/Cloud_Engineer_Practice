Goal:
Create a custom network environment in AWS with:
-Custom VPC
- 2 subnets (public + private)
- Internet Gateway + NAT Gateway
- EC2 in the public subnet
- Private subnet ready for DB (e.g., RDS) later
- Fully automated with Terraform

Project Overview
-VPC:	Custom VPC (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
-Subnets:	1 public (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24), 1 private (e.g., 10.0.2.0/24)
-Internet Gateway:	For public subnet internet access
-NAT Gateway:	So private subnet instances can reach internet
-Route Tables:	Separate for public and private routes
-EC2 Instance:	Launch in public subnet (e.g., Nginx installed)

Practicing
-VPC structure + subnetting
-Terraform modules, variables, outputs
-Routing concepts (IGW, NAT, route tables)
-Infrastructure automation from zero
-(Bonus) Security groups, EC2 key pair handling
