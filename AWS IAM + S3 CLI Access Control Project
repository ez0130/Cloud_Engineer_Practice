1. AWS IAM + S3 CLI Access Control Project

2. Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use AWS IAM to create a **CLI-only IAM user** (`s3-user`) with restricted **read-only access to Amazon S3**.  
It follows the **Principle of Least Privilege**, ensuring that the user can access only what is necessary â€” and nothing more.

##  Learning Objectives

- Understand IAM user, group, and policy structure
- Configure programmatic-only access via access keys
- Practice permission-based resource access control
- Use the AWS CLI to validate access to S3 only

##  Project Setup

| Component        | Value                      |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| IAM User         | `s3-user`                  |
| Access Type      | Programmatic only (CLI)    |
| Policy Attached  | `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`   |
| CLI Profile Name | `s3user`                   |
| AWS Region       | `us-east-2` (Ohio)         |

## ðŸ›  Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. Create IAM User (Programmatic Access Only)

- Go to IAM â†’ Add User
- Select **"I want to create an IAM user"**
- **Do NOT enable console access**
- Proceed with user creation
- After creation, go to the **Security credentials** tab
- Create an **access key** (for CLI use)

### 2. Attach IAM Policy

- Navigate to the `s3-user` user â†’ Permissions tab
- Attach the managed policy: `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`

### 3. Configure AWS CLI

Run the following in terminal or PowerShell:

```bash
aws configure --profile s3user


Then enter:
-Access Key ID: (from IAM user)
-Secret Access Key: (from IAM user)
-Region: us-east-2
-Output format: json



Test Access via CLI
-List all S3 buckets:
aws s3 ls --profile s3user

-List contents of a specific bucket:
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name --profile s3user

-Try accessing EC2 (should be denied):
aws ec2 describe-instances --profile s3user

-Expected output:
An error occurred (UnauthorizedOperation): You are not authorized to perform this operation
